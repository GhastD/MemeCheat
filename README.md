What is Meme Anticheat you may ask? Well it's simple: We're a combat based anticheat which offers a free solution, alternative to JI Anticheat or Artemis, to contribute to the community. We don't provide a full-on system as that would defeat the purpose, however we do offer a reliable solution to use as an alternative.
